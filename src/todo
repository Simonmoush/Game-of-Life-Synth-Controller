as it stands the game of life is too concerned with making sound
it should not be concerned at all with how the information it sends
is used.
for example it currently sends a message that has a pitch and duration.
it should just send location and time delay. those can be interpretted by the server
as it sees fit.

Related to this issue is the fact that key squares are only sent when they are new and normal
squares are sent every update. All squares should be sent, and the sound server can decide
to use or ignore new/returning squares


don't send control messages on every note, they should be sent once per update
send the time delay only when it changes? or on every update? best to be on setup and then when it changes
